Cryptocurrencies are playing a pivotal role in digitalizing money. With the exponential rise in the previous decade, the cryptocurrency market is a three trillion-dollar market attracting many new investors every day. In our work, we aim to help new cryptocurrency investors devise an investment strategy through ex-post-facto research. We use 2-sample one-tailed T-tests to compare group means and aim to test the 
statistical difference. We test if tokens give better returns than coins and if minable coins give better  returns than non-mineable ones. We also test the market sentiment if Mondays give better results than  investments on other weekdays. The final method aims to detect a time-lagged cross-correlation between  traded volume and daily average returns. At a significance level of 0.05, we get statistically significant 
results with a p-value of 4.385e-06(p<0.0001) and 0.03825 for the first two testsrespectively. For the third  test, we do not have enough evidence to reject the market sentiment. For the correlation test, we found  a -0.15 correlation for log return and traded volume with a one-day lag. From the investorâ€™s point of view, 
our work suggests that investing in tokens over coins gives better returns. If the investor still wants to invest in coins, mineable is better than non-mineable. The investor can invest on any of the days. We  would recommend an investor trade a particular cryptocurrency if it had a low return the previous day.
